	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello, I'm Ronan Armstrong, multimedia specialist and musician. Please feel free to look through this resume, and reach out to me with any questions you may have.</p>
	<h2>Recording</h2>
	<h3>Production</h3>
	<p>Since I was 5, I have been engrossed with writing and producing songs for both myself and my friends and family. I started taking classical composition lessons with Dr. Sarah Miller, and continued studying a variety of styles under her until I was 18.</p>
	<p>I became interested in modern music production after I was introduced to Logic Pro X by a friend of mine when I was 14. Since then, I've produced a wide selection of music, including contemporary pop, hip-hop and R&B, EDM, 80's rock (experimental and glam), synthwave, and many more.</p>
	<p>My strong foundation in classical technique has given me a unique perspective and approach to popular music, and I try to push myself to my limit in every project I undertake.</p>
	<h3>Engineering</h3>
	<p>Shortly after I started using Logic Pro X, I became fascinated with the technical aspects of the tools used in music production. While I studied on my own for a few years, it wasn't until I attended McNally Smith College of Music in 2017 that I learned how large the technology world actually was. It was there that I began learning about the many aspects of both analog and digital recording, and when McNally Smith closed unexpectedly in December of 2017, I pushed myself harder than ever to learn as much as possible, pulling from contacts I made at McNally Smith and the many master classes and user manuals available on the internet.</p>
	<p>Since I started studying music engineering, I've familiarized myself with many of the most popular pieces of equipment and software used in studio enviroments, including a variety of recording consoles, patchbays, and DAWs/plugins. After buying an analog recording console in the spring of 2018, I took it upon myself to hand wire a patchbay system, including both full and half normal connections, solder-type and ADC punchdown, and over a half mile of cable from Redco.</p>

    <h2>Media Production</h2>
    <h3>Visual</h3>
    <p>Visual media has always been a passion of mine, and I've worked on multiple professional projects, including camera and editing work on local television programs and training videos.</p>
    <p>Outside of video work, I'm an accomplished front end design specialist (please see my "Coding" section for more information regarding this), photo editor, and brand consistency specialist. I've worked with a variety of clients to develop their brand and create a consistent image across social media and print/physical mediums.</p>
    <h3>Audio</h3>
    <p>While my primary passion is music, I'm comfortable in commercial audio settings as well.

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <h3>Front End</h3>
    <p>I've been designing and coding user interfaces since I was 12 years old, and have had a significant amount of experience in creating user friendly, accessible interfaces for a variety of clients including Strom Aviation, and a variety of intranet systems.</p>
    <p>Within interface design, my primary focus has been responsive and accessible design. The majority of web traffic since 2016 has come from a mobile device, and I believe creating a clean interface optimized for low bandwidth connections is crucial in today's web design landscape. To achieve this, I prioritize efficient code coupled with clean and responsive CSS over primarily JavaScript based solutions.</p>
    <h3>Back End</h3>
    <p>To complement my experience designing user interfaces, I started designing back end systems in 2016. I've worked with a variety of back end languages ranging from classic ASP to Meteor.js. As a designer, my main focus is on efficient data retrieval and secure data storage. I've worked extensively with hashing/salting sensitive information, as well as a variety of other data security techniques.</p>
    <p>While my specialty is front end design, I think a clean user interface must be able to interact in a logical and efficient way with the back end, which is why I've learned a variety of database systems, including SQL, Access, MySQL, and MongoDB. I'm also familiar with database structure, including key-value pair systems and NoSQL.</p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>Because the website design industry changes so quickly, I try to maintain a comprehensive understanding of the logic behind many current trends, so I can keep current with my designs and code styles.</p>
    <p>With that said, I currently am using the following software:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2019</li>
        <li>Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Dreamweaver</li>
        <li>GitHub</li>
        <li>CodePen</li>
        <li>Koala SCSS/SASS Manager</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and for the library/languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3</li>
        <li>JavaScript (ES5/6)</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>Angular.js</li>
        <li>React.js</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Meteor.js (Based on Node)</li>
        <li>Bootstrap 4</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm also familiar with hundreds of user libraries and plugins, but this comprises the core of my coding preferences.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <h3>McNally Smith College of Music</h3>
    <span class="subTitle">Fall 2017 - December 2017</span>
    <p>I attended McNally Smith up until it's untimely closing in December 2017.</p>
