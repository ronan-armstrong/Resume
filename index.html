	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello, I'm Ronan Armstrong, multimedia specialist and musician. Please feel free to look through this resume, and reach out to me with any questions you may have.</p>
	<h2>Recording</h2>
	<h3>Production</h3>
	<p>Since I was 5, I have been engrossed with writing and producing songs for both myself and my friends and family. I started taking classical composition lessons with Dr. Sarah Miller, and continued studying a variety of styles under her until I was 18.</p>
	<p>I became interested in modern music production after I was introduced to Logic Pro X by a friend of mine when I was 14. Since then, I've produced a wide selection of music, including contemporary pop, hip-hop and R&B, EDM, 80's rock (experimental and glam), synthwave, and many more.</p>
	<p>My strong foundation in classical technique has given me a unique perspective and approach to popular music, and I try to push myself to my limit in every project I undertake.</p>
	<h3>Engineering</h3>
	<p>Shortly after I started using Logic Pro X, I became fascinated with the technical aspects of the tools used in music production. While I studied on my own for a few years, it wasn't until I attended McNally Smith College of Music in 2017 that I learned how large the technology world actually was. It was there that I began learning about the many aspects of both analog and digital recording, and when McNally Smith closed unexpectedly in December of 2017, I pushed myself harder than ever to learn as much as possible, pulling from contacts I made at McNally Smith and the many master classes and user manuals available on the internet.</p>
	<p>Since I started studying music engineering, I've familiarized myself with many of the most popular pieces of equipment and software used in studio enviroments, including a variety of recording consoles, patchbays, and DAWs/plugins.</p>
